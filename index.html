    <h1>Rhiannon Brafford</h1>
    <p>I get carried away with this brush cleaning. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. 
    Just beat the devil out of it. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. If it's not what you want - 
    stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.</p>

    <p>We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to 
    you to make friends with the little rascals. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a
    good day. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you 
    can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.</p>
    
    <p>The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, 
    you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. You can 
    do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an 
    angel's wing. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. 
    We don't want to set these clouds on fire.</p>
    
    <p>I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Let's 
    put some happy little clouds in our world. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Every day I learn. This is
    your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are.</p>
    
    <p>start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. So often we avoid running water, and running water 
    is a lot of fun. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Every highlight needs it's own personal 
    shadow. We'll play with clouds today.</p>
    
    <p>Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends 
    with it. Every time you practice, you learn more. This is unplanned it really just happens.</p>
    
    <p>That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. A fan brush can be your best friend. 
    Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.</p>
